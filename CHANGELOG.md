## [Unreleased]

### Security

- OpenSSF Scorecard workflow and README badge.
- actionlint and zizmor audit the workflows in the lint job.
- Workflows get a read-only token by default, wider permissions only per job.
- Checkouts drop the git credentials, except in the version bump that pushes.
- Shell steps read workflow expressions from environment variables.
- Renovate pins GitHub Actions by commit digest.
- `SECURITY.md` links to the advisory form of this repository.
- The kcov coverage image is pinned by digest, and Renovate keeps it current.
- Releases carry a signed build provenance bundle (`*.intoto.jsonl`).

### Added

- Disclaimer and License sections in the README.

### Fixed

- CI runs once per commit on a Renovate branch; a second push run blocked the automerge.
- A rerun of the release workflow uploads the files to the existing release.
